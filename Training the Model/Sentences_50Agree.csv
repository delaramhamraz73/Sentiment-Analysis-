the broadest shoulders on which to bear such losses,0
it is hard to ascertain how much worse things could get.,0
"With this huge health crisis and economic downturn, we are all of a sudden seeing how risky it is to have the ownership split between the real estate side that has the most valuable asset and the operator, who is left with much less.",0
"That would be the worst such decline since 2009, and pandemic shutdowns only began toward the end of the quarter.",0

what's worrying them,0
investor confidence in the asset class has actually dipped slightly,0
last few years' vintages are likely to post lacklustre performance,0
LPs are certainely concerned about it,0
selling a stake to an outside investor makes a GP a less attractive investment partner,0
investors should hold their nerve,0
it took time to for valuations to be written down by GPs,0
fall in the value,0
You can’t time the markets in this asset class,0
otherwise you risk missing out on returns,0
I’ve been expecting a market downturn for many years now,0
It’s not great to find that one or two companies in a PE fund fail,0
please don’t change your investment strategy,0
It’s not a time to start moving into something totally different,0
The rationale for urging investors to remain cautious,0
The difficulty for these funds is predicting the end of what has been a long economic growth cycle,0
"Opinion was divided on whether coronavirus could prompt a downturn, with some saying that the effect it has on supply chains could intensify an economic slowdown",0
"For PE firms, however, the question is less about when the next downturn will come than how to respond when it arrives.",0

"Countries are pulling varying levers to contain the virus, creating economic uncertainty, and China’s trajectory suggests that countries will face a near-term shock from contraction in economic activity.",0
43% of respondents saying they expect valuations to come down more than 20%.,0
"India also witnessed a decline in exit value in 2019, relative to the previous two years, resulting from a decreasing number of exits throughout the year",0
"However, the China PE market retracted with a decline in both deal value and volume due to trade war concerns, social unrest and stringent Renminbi fundraising regulations.",0
"This is slightly lower than last year, when the top 15 deals made up almost 40% of the total value",0
"Exits decreased finishing at nearly $13 billion, slightly lower than the last two years (ex-Flipkart 2018 exit).",0
This fall was primarily driven by a reduction in exits from 265 to 200.,0
"Additionally, China experienced a dip in investment activity in early 2020 as a result of the Covid-19 crisis",0
They are also significantly more worried about geopolitical conditions than they were a year earlier.,0

"It’s become increasingly clear that the model of public ownership is increasingly falling out of favor, at least for many companies in the middle-market space and those in the more growth-oriented stages of their maturity curves",0
Closing a long position in a security would entail selling it to avoid the risk of price decline.,0
"even if a large number of distressed sellers come to market at once, their numbers are likely to be countered by opportunistic sellers pulling back due to a weaker price environment.",0
"we still sometimes see some questionable financial behaviour, which has to be discouraged.",0
Misapplication of funds is a situation where monies are actually used for a purpose that they are not intended for.,0
an asset is tagged as non performing when it ceases to generate income for the lender.,0
"the exact elements of nonperforming status can vary depending on the specific loan's terms, ""no payment"" is usually defined as zero payments of either principal or interest.",0
Persistence in returns has decreased.,0
"the more you spotlight performance comparisons, the harder it is for all of these asset managers to look good.",0
"standard financial metrics intended to enable comparisons from one company to another, often fall short, giving rise to unofficial measures that have their own problems.",0
"Many buyout GPs do not have the ability to recycle proceeds, so they need to make fund term amendment requests to fund LPs.",0
"Bertrand-Delfau said secondaries market transaction volumes are likely to slow in the next two quarters due to the impact of the coronavirus, thereby reducing the chances that funds will breach their 2 percent transfer limits.",0
